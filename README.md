# Malaria-Detection-with-PyTorch

Introduction: 
Malaria is an old and well-known disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites within the Plasmodium genus. There are several that can cause disease within humans, the most well known of which is Plasmodium falciprum. Currently, there are several barriers in the detection and erradication of this disease. To this end, there are several approaches in each of these avenues. This project is a training project in AI geared for the detection of Plasmodium parasites within human blood smears from publically available data from the Center for Disease Control.
